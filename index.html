            <img src="images/aWorldnotSoFarAway.png" alt="subaru forester of roading">
            <p>My name is Alexandre Trepanier i am a 20 year old guy that lives in Cantley , Quebec i am taking graphic design at algonquin college and i am a zipline rescuer on the side. I have 2 little sisters that love to go ski with me on the weekends and my mom and dad own a car lighting company so i have always been in a car nut environment. The picture i have chosen is well a car ! i love them plus every picture i have of me is too high res for this assignement i dont want you having to stare at my forehead while grading hahaha.</p>

            <p>This class aswell as next year's ui/ux classes are probably going to be the two most relevant classes to my desired professional career web design and ui ux</p>

            <p>When in doubt flat out ! </p>
